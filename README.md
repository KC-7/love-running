## Technologies Used
The Love Running Club website was built using HTML5 and CSS3.

### CSS

CSS is used for styling the headings, navigation links, hero image, club ethos section, event times, footer, gallery, and the form. 

The code imports Google fonts for the Lato and Oswald font families and sets global styling for all elements. 

The headings and logo have specific styling, as do the navigation links, with a hover effect and a class for an active link. 

The hero image has an animation for a zoom effect and a cover text section with specific styling.

The club ethos section is divided into three columns, with headings and hr tags. 

The event times section has a background image and specific styling for the time divs. 

The footer includes social network icons with specific styling. 

The gallery has a column layout, and the form section has a background image and specific styling.

A zoom animation was utilised when hovering over background images. 

Media queries were used to adjust the layout and styles of the elements on the page for different screen sizes.
